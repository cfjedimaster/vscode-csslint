# CSSLint for VSCode

My first draft at an extension for [VSCode](http://code.visualstudio.com). This is *really* rough and does not support .cslintrc yet. Be gentle.

Note: Be sure to disable VSCode's internal CSS linting by adding:

    "css.validate": false

to your preferences.

# History
April 2, 2018: Two PRs from @mseiler025. One is cleanup, one adds a 'clear issues on document close setting'. 

June 12, 2017: First, took in a PR from @coliff that added an icon (thanks!). I then did
a bunch of cleanup while I was trying to get the darn thing running again on my laptop.
